# Employee Database Analysis
A large company (i.e. "PH") employee data, having 300,024 employees working in 9 departments, has been analyzed to retrieve the number of retiring-soon employees and to find the number of employees eligible to participate in a part-time mentorship program. The result of this analysis should help the management and HR to plan ahead about new recruiting if a big number of employees retire soon.

## Overview of the Analysis
  * Scope of the data analysis
    * This project requires *data modeling, engineering* and *analysis* of the employee data. Initially, an entity (i.e., tables) relationship diagram (ERD) is created (Fig. 1) using **QuickDBD** by identifying primary- and foreign-key(s) in each of the 6 tables as shown below,
      - departments,
      - dept_emp,
      - dept_manager,
      - employees,
      - salaries,
      - titles.
